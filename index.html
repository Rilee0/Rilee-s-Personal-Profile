    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>My name is Rilee Young and I am a year 10 at <a href="https://www.wakatipu.school.nz/" id="link_2">Wakatipu High School</a>.
        I was born in Auckland, and moved down to Queenstown in April 2018. 
        I live in Shotover country with my mum, dad and sister. 
        I went to Shotover Primary School until the end of year 6, before moving to Queenstown Primary School. 
        I have been attending Wakatipu High for one and a half years.
        I enjoy exploring the backcountry on foot and bike with my family and friends.</p>
